Day ahead Energy trading for Great Britain market

Using UK Energy Trading Dataset through a systematic approach, we will seek to develop a simple trading algorithm to maximize profits from non-physical financial trades between two auctions of the day-ahead market in Great Britain's electricity market.

Our approach will involve:

data preprocessing
developing a price forecasting model
determining the optimal trading strategy
implementing the trading algorithm in Python
finally testing and optimizing the algorithm.
We will go through these steps one by one.

1. Gather and preprocess the data
Letâ€˜s first preprocess all of the input data by cleaning and formatting it in a way that can be used by the algorithm. Starting with Auction Data which has actual prices and traded volumes data of both auctions as well as the price forecast for the first auction.

First let's see the files we have in the dataset.
