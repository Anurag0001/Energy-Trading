Day ahead Energy trading for Great Britain market

Using UK Energy Trading Dataset through a systematic approach, we will seek to develop a simple trading algorithm to maximize profits from non-physical financial trades between two auctions of the day-ahead market in Great Britain's electricity market.

Our approach will involve:

data preprocessing
developing a price forecasting model
determining the optimal trading strategy
implementing the trading algorithm in Python
finally testing and optimizing the algorithm.
We will go through these steps one by one.
